1. Project Title

  Data Governance Framework for Smart City Initiative

3. Overview
 
    A Master’s thesis project that develops a comprehensive data governance framework for Darwin City’s Smart City initiative. The framework addresses legal compliance, data security, operational efficiency, and transparency, offering a scalable model that can be adapted by other cities aiming to embrace digital transformation.

4. Objectives

  * Ensure compliance with the Information Act 2002 and Australian Privacy Laws
  
  * Improve operational efficiency in urban data workflows
  
  * Strengthen data security and protection
  
  * Foster open innovation and transparency
  
  * Provide scalable governance guidelines for smart city ecosystems

4. Methodology

  * Designed a multi-phase data workflow using BPMN

  * Incorporated stakeholder feedback across development phases

  * Conducted hypothetical testing to simulate real-world data challenges (e.g., high data request volumes, data quality issues, sensitive data disposal)

5. Results & Contribution

  * Delivered a theoretical governance model tailored for Darwin City
  
  * Created Data Governance Guidelines covering storage, access, quality, and compliance
  
  * Provides a reference model for other cities transitioning into smart city infrastructures
